- Tkinter (usually included with Python installations)
- `mysql.connector` library

Installation and Setup:

1. Clone the project repository from GitHub.
2. Navigate to the Project Directory.
3. Install the required dependencies using `pip install mysql-connector-python`.
4. Set Up the Database.
5. Update Database Configuration in the main.py file.
6. Run the Application with `python main.py`.

Usage:

- Ensure you have Python and the required dependencies installed.
- Set up your MySQL database and create the necessary tables with sample data.
- Update the database connection settings in the Python script (main.py) to match your database configuration.
- Run the Application with `python main.py`.
